Recently, I finished the Career Essentials in Generative AI by Microsoft and LinkedIn exam by ChatGPT.

Career Essentials in Generative AI by Microsoft and LinkedIn is a free course source. It helps to understand the Essentials in Generative AI.

The exam is challenging. I decided to solve it with ChatGPT. And the final score is 83.
